Build a modern FinTech web app called “Budget Buddy”.
This app is a personal finance tracker with AI-powered savings advice.
It must be built using React + TailwindCSS, with Supabase for authentication & database, and easily deployable on Netlify.

🔑 Features & Requirements
1. Authentication (Supabase)

Implement sign up, login, and logout using Supabase Auth.

Users must only see their own data after login.

2. Database (Supabase)

Create a table: expenses with columns:

id (primary key, uuid)

user_id (references Supabase auth user)

amount (float)

category (text)

date (date)

note (text)

Ensure all expenses are linked to the logged-in user only.

3. Dashboard

Show total expenses for the current month with an animated counter effect.

Display a pie chart of expenses grouped by category using Recharts (preferred) or Chart.js.

Add smooth page transitions with Framer Motion.

4. Expense Entry Form

Build a modern card-style form with floating input labels for:

Amount (number input)

Category (dropdown: Food, Transport, Shopping, Bills, Others)

Note (text input)

On submit, insert data into Supabase and show a success animation (e.g., a green checkmark popup).

5. AI Advice Feature

Add a section called “Get Smart Advice”.

When the user clicks the button:

Fetch the last 10 expenses from Supabase (in JSON).

Send this data to OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini or GPT-4) with a prompt like:

“Based on these expenses, give 2 short saving tips in under 40 words each.”

Display the response in a chat bubble UI with a typing animation.

6. About Page

Simple page with text:

“App Published by Sreeja Thati”

Add a card flip animation when hovering or loading.

7. UI/UX Guidelines

Use modern finance app design:

Gradient backgrounds

Rounded cards with drop shadows

Smooth hover animations on buttons

Mobile responsive layout

Apply Framer Motion animations for page transitions, hover effects, and chat typing.

8. Deployment

Ensure the app is ready for deployment on Netlify (frontend only).

Supabase will serve as backend for auth + database.
